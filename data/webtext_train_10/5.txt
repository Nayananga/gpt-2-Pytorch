Kim Kardashian is jumping on the hype wave and releasing a fidget spinner. The spinner is a gold money symbol and it says "daddy," which is apt since it's called the Daddy Money Fidget Spinner. It can be yours — with a seven-day shipping delay because these things take time — for the low price of $15, plus $4 for shipping

Fidget spinners are apparently still a thing. But since I could not give less of a shit about them, I asked my colleague and noted fidget spinner enthusiast, Ashley Carman, what she thought about Kim's latest business endeavor.

"I would never spend $15 on a Kim K spinner," says Carman.

Well there you have it. Have a nice weekend.
